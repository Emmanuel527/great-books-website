It is my attempt to both explore and share the ideas that drives our species. My aim with this is to give the reader the spark of curiosity and wonder needed to delve into the interconnected world of ideas. In each category are the selection of books I have picked for this project so the reader can simply use this as a book recommendation system and jump into the texts themselves if they so please.</p>
